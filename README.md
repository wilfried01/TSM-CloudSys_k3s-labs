# K8S-Lab

## GOAL

In this exercise, students will deploy a Kubernetes cluster locally to manage an application that retrieves and stores electrical consumption data, forecasts future consumption, and presents both historical and projected consumption trends. As a fundamental component, students will replicate the local database.


## Example Architecture

## Kubernetes in Docker (Kind)

Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) is a tool designed to facilitate the running of local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as nodes.  It simplifies the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster by eliminating the need for virtual machines or cloud infrastructure, making it accessible and efficient for developers and testers. With kind, clusters can be created, managed, and deleted using straightforward commands, allowing for quick iterations and experiments. Its flexibility supports multi-node clusters, enabling realistic testing scenarios and the development of distributed applications in an environment closely resembling production. For further detail you can read this [web site](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

## Programs

### Data Retrieval

Data Retrieval is a Python program that reads an S3 bucket, retrieves and reads a CSV file, and writes the data into a distributed Redis database. **This program is run only once to ingest data into the system**. It the 10 devices from the CSV and inserts them into Redis as a RedisTimeSeries dataset. It also creates a Redis Queue with Device ID, which is used to retrieve from the RedisTimeSeries  (if possible, it sets a key-value structure in the queue [id, RedisTimeSeries]).

### Forecast

Based on the data provided, forecasts X amounts of days in the future. It utilizes LSTM to forecast based on historical data. It will create as many instances as devices in the database (in this case, it will be capped at 10 instances/devices). Every minute, it will forecast the following day, storing the result in the database as a RedisTimeSeries.

### Redis

Redis is an in-memory database largely used as a cache. In this case, we’ll use a document store to store historical and forecasted data. It is replicated and provides an automated way to replicate data across instances. 

### Grafana

Grafana is an analytics visualization platform which will be used to visualize the historical and forecasted data being processed. It connects to Redis and displays the RedisTimeSeries as a line graph, showing passed and future power consumption.

## Composition

## Steps

### Setup
1. Clone this repository and create an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
4. Create a [Kind configuration file](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#multi-node-clusters) composed of one control-plane node, and 5 worker nodes
5. Create a cluster using the configuration file
6. Setup kubectl - the default Kubernetes CLI tool - [to interact with the Kind Cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#interacting-with-your-cluster).

Kind will create a cluster by deploying a docker container for each node in the cluster. Each container will have a kubernetes runtime, and kind will setup the required networking to make the cluster work.

At this point, you should be able visualize your cluster by running:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output should be something similar to:
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                       NAMES
16f273bb6081   kindest/node:v1.31.0            "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   4 hours ago   Up 4 hours                               kind-worker4
ac54f2f5d5b1   kindest/node:v1.31.0            "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   4 hours ago   Up 4 hours   127.0.0.1:64379->6443/tcp   kind-control-plane
dad309f973d4   kindest/node:v1.31.0            "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   4 hours ago   Up 4 hours                               kind-worker5
b2de27161ffa   kindest/node:v1.31.0            "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   4 hours ago   Up 4 hours                               kind-worker3
4ede6be6659c   kindest/node:v1.31.0            "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   4 hours ago   Up 4 hours                               kind-worker
f4a46caed4f2   kindest/node:v1.31.0            "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   4 hours ago   Up 4 hours                               kind-worker2
```

You can see the control-plane and worker nodes. Now, by doing `kubectl get all` you should get an output similar to:

```bash
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   3h37m
```

#### Creating a Secret Key

```bash
kubectl create secret generic aws-secret \
  --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your access key> \
  --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key>
```

You are ready to deploy services to your cluster.

### Deployment Files

Kubernetes services can be deployed using Deployment Files, `YAML` files that describe how and where a service should be deployed. In this repositiory you have a folder called `code` which has the following structure:
```bash
|- code/
|---- data-retreival/
|---- forcast/
|---- data-retrieval-deployment.yaml
|---- forecast-deployment.yaml
|---- grafana-deployment.yaml
|---- redis-deployment.yaml
```

The `data-retrieval-deployment.yaml` and `forecast-deployment.yaml` files are to be completed.

### Code

Both the `data-retrieval` and `forecast` folders have the following structure:

```bash
|- data-retrieval/
|---- main.py
|---- requirements.txt
|---- Dockerfile
```

The `main.py` file has some functions that need to be finished before the container is build. Also, the `Dockerfile` needs to be completed, and a container be created and pushed to Docker Hub. 

## Deployment

The application needs to be deployed in the following order:
1. Redis + Grafana
2. Data Retrieval - It needs to finish before the next step
3. Forecast

If the order isn't followed, there will be several errors happening. `Redis` needs to be the first to be deployed as both the `Data-Retrieval` and `Forecast` are dependant on it. 

## Exercises

1. Install, configure and deploy Kind
2. Finish both the `data-retrieval` and the `forecast` code. WARNING: make sure to only finish what is asked in the code. Do not change anything else.
3. Create the Dockerfile for both the `data-retrieval` and `forecast`. 
    a. Build the containers.
    b. Push the containers to Docker Hub
4. Finish the kubernetes deployment files
5. Deploy the application
6. Build a Grafana dashboard to visualize the forecasted data.
